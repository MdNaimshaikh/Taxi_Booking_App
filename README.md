# Taxi_Booking_App
This Taxi Booking Application is developed using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. The backend is powered by Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable architecture for handling user requests, business logic, and interaction with the database. Hibernate is used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), simplifying database operations and management. The front-end is rendered using Thymeleaf, which integrates seamlessly with the Spring Boot framework for creating dynamic web pages. MySQL serves as the database, storing essential data such as user information, booking details, and taxi schedules. The app allows users to book taxis, track rides, and manage their accounts efficiently. you can see through http://localhost:8091/
